    <p>Dear Dr. {name},<br>
      <br><br>
       UCLA Health is reaching out to primary care patients with serious illness who have no advance care planning documentation in CareConnect in the past three years to encourage these patients to complete an advance directive and bring it to their primary care physician.  To evaluate the effect of this system-wide quality improvement intervention, we will survey some of these patients about advance care planning.
<br>
<br>
The patients listed below are candidates for this survey.  Please review the list and reply to this email to let us know if we should exclude any patient from being approached to participate because:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>the patient is cognitively incapable of being surveyed or</li>
  <li>the patient would be harmed by being surveyed or</li>
  <li>the patient does not speak English or Spanish.</li>
</ul>

List of your patients
    
    <br>
       {patients}
<br>
<br>
If you do not respond with patients to be excluded, we will assume that all patients can be contacted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you,
<br>
